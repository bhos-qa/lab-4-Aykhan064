# Coverage Analysis Report

1. **Statement Coverage**  
   This metric ensures that every line of code is executed at least once during testing. It aims to uncover parts of the code that may not have been run, enhancing overall test effectiveness.

2. **Branch Coverage**  
   This measures whether all decision points (like if and switch statements) have been executed across their possible outcomes. It ensures that each logical branch is assessed for any discrepancies in behavior.

3. **Predicate Coverage**  
   The focus here is on evaluating individual conditions within complex boolean expressions to ascertain their true or false states. This coverage guarantees that all combinations of boolean variables are tested to identify potential logical errors.
